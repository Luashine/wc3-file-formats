# war3map.wpm Format

"Warcraft Pathing Map" holds the pathing information. If the map has a `.wpm` file,
it is preferred over the `war3mapPath.tga` file.

The reading starts at map's bottom left and ends at map's top right.

Whether a unit can traverse an "allowed" tile depends on the unit's pathing ability and type.
