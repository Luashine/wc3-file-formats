# What is Kaitai Struct

It's a declarative file format parser that generates code in multiple languages based on a template.

It was a pleasure to work with the web IDE:
https://ide.kaitai.io/devel/

Unfortunately it doesn't support writing aka serialization yet (it's on a development branch in alpha stage and only for Java iirc).
Although it's read-only, but it's a great help to reverse engineer unknown formats. Quick and easy visualization is all I needed.
